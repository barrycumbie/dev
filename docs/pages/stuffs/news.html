DAY 01...JUNE 4 

Hello CIS 376!

Welcome to all of you Web Devs to your Summer ’24 CIS 376 Course.

💀💀💀 Dying here... I totally thought that tomorrow (Wednesday) was the first day of summer classes; even though I have
it in all my schedules and calendar. I’ve been putting on the finishing touches today for a planned release tomorrow.
I’ll give you something for today for those ready to get going!

- A quick hello: https://youtu.be/z827oTaLr1U
- No book for this class
- No premium or paid accounts for anything we use.
- Things to get started on before more info coming tomorrow
- Get an account on GitHub
- Use your GitHub login to CodeAcademy
- Get going on the “Learn HTML” course
- https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html
- (only the free sections…no premium content)
- (if you’ve already completed this is the past…cool! start on “Learn CSS” … “Learn Bootstrap” …)
- That’s all for now
- Come back tomorrow for all the Syllabus stuff, assignments, schedule, and all.

Sorry about missing our first day 🤦🏼‍♂️
